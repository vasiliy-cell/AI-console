I've decided to make the CLI much more user-friendly by integrating AI.
From now on, you can simply describe what you want in plain English (or any natural language), 
and the AI-powered API will automatically convert it into the correct command. 


## instaletion guide
1. kreate api key on https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys (its not free but cheap)
2. copy api key to .config/AICLI/api_key.txt(NAME IS MATTER IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT CHANGE ALSO AICLI_path IN utils/config_loader.py)
